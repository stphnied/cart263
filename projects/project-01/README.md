## Artistâ€™s statement
For the `A Night at the Movies` project, I decided to recreated an interactive  scene from the movie BIG HERO 6 
by programming my own version of Baymax. The scene that I recreated is the first meeting between Hiro and Baymax.
I wanted to challenge myself by using more than one new technologies that we have learnt in class.

My main goal is to create cute things and Baymax is a cute robot. That is the main reason why I chose to base my project on this.

My project is to program Baymax while recreating this particular [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwocZbI3T-w&ab_channel=NicoleLatham) and make it interactive.
For the technical aspect, I used ResponsiveVoice, Annyang, Video capture, JSON data and Web storage. I decided to give my Baymax a voice by
using the ResponsiveVoice library, although I had to sligthly tweak the voice to replicate the original. Then, I utilize the Annyang library
to allow the user to interact with Baymax by using their voice. There will be some keywords that will trigger some events, i.e saying "ouch" will activate the program.
I generated my own JSON data to easily store all of Baymax's dialogues and also made use of the Web Storage to save the player's name. The program will also ask the user to turn on their webcam to scan them, just like the scene seen above.The player will also be able to interact with our robot with their mouse. The first part of the project will be the remake of the scene shown above. The user will follow a linear path to reach the second part of the program,
which allows the user to do interact with Baymax openly.

For the artistic aspect, as mentioned before, I wanted to make it cute so I decided to make it flat design. First, I created Baymax's appearance by using and combining shapes from p5.js library. As for the background, I decided to create them with the help of Adobe Illustrator. I also decide to remake the 10 emotions icons to fit the general design of my project. For the color palette, I first used the 3 colors that reminded me of Big Hero 6, which are red, white and black. I inspired my color palette for the landscape from the movie's background when it was daytime and nighttime. 

Overall, I am satisfied with how my project turned out. At first, I felt overwhelmed by this project and had no clue how to approach it. Fortunately, I was able to program my own Baymax robot. I am pleased with the final aesthethic oh my project as it is cute. I did encounter a lot of issue regarding playing Baymax's dialogues and I believe some part of my code could have been more efficient, however I managed to make it work as intended. I am hoping to work on even cuter project and be able to code more efficiently.
