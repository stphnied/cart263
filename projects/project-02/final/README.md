# Project 02 : Gachapyon <br/>
## Artist’s statement
"The final project can be anything". Having such freedom is always a bit terrifying as I am not sure where I want to go with this project.
Looking back at my previous project for the Creative Computation classes, I noticed a weakness in my projects: lack of interactivity.
This time, I wanted to make sure the user will have his hand occupy by clicking and interacting with items. From then I decided to make a gacha game called Gachapyon [Gachapyon](https://stphnied.github.io/cart263/projects/project-02/final/). The user will play as a cat that likes to collect toys from capsule games. They will be able to spend money to play and earn money to enjoy their hobbies. The end goal is to collect all
the toys from the machines. To earn money, they will have to get a job and  will be rewarded depending on their performance.

From an artistic point of view, I am rather pleased with my work. The assets that I have created are something that really helps sets up the mood for my game simulation. My intention was to bring back those old Flash games that we all used to play during our childhood. The storyline is quite simple with a twist where you play as a cat. The game is a "gambling" simulation that satisfies our need to spend catacoins to get cute rewards (instead of spending real money). I would also like to give credit to all the assets that I have taken from the Internet (see below).  

From a more technical part, I was able to achieve the overall functionalities of my game with the help of multiple technologies such as 
Html3/CSS5, JavaScript, JQuery/JqueryUI, LocalStorage, JSON, and P5.js. I was able to assemble my assets together and add multiple interactivities with JS and JQuery. As for the minigames, P5.js was the way to go as it is easier to create quick and simple interactive games.
By combining everything, I was able to create my game Gachapon. Due to lack of time,  I had to cut out a few parts of my game, including the gacha section and storing the items. Although I knew this was a project of a big scale, I think I might have underestimated the amount of work implied. Nonetheless, I am quite satisfied with the final version of this project. I do intend on working on it again this summer to complete the missing section.
